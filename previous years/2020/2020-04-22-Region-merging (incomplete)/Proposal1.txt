proposal 1:

regions are modelled by binary masks
( we have to define a new data structure 'Region')

pros:
- very easy to evaluate the predicate (OpenCV functions accept binary masks)
- very easy to merge (you only have to use logical '|' operator)
- easy to detect adjacent regions (just consider a 1-pixel dilated version of the region and then use the '&' operator)

cons:
- every region has its own binary mask
- one binary mask has the same size of the original image
- we may have > 100,000 regions, each has a binary mask
- RAM size (one binary mask) = 1 bytes x (rows x cols) > 1 MB
- total RAM (peak) usage = 100,000 MB = 100 GB
- in a more realistic case (10,000 regions) we need 10 GB
